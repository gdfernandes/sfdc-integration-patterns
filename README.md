Integration Patterns for Salesforce
================

## Introduction

I'm using this repository to create code in both Ruby and Kotlin, which are the two languages I want to learn for backend and CLI utilities development

I'll kepp Kotlin code here and I'll create a separete repo for storing Ruby code. I think they are both simple to understand but they are quite different languages.

I'll also try to use TensorFlow for image recogninition and, also, I'll try to create a reference architecture for Salesforce.
